## Traditional NLP Metrics

The direct use of metrics such as perplexity and BLEU score has declined in popularity, largely due to their inherent flaws in many contexts. However, it remains crucial to comprehend these metrics and discern their appropriate applications.


### BLEU

[Paper: BLEU: a Method for Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation](https://aclanthology.org/P02-1040.pdf)

Originally developed to measure machine translation. BLEU scores are based on an average of unigram, bigram, trigram and 4-gram precision


![alt_text](evaluations/images/image11.png "image_tooltip")


**Example1:**

candidate: the cat sat on the mat

reference: the cat is on the mat

bleu1 score = ‚Öö = 0.83

bleu2 score = ‚Öó = 0.6

Checking for the occurrence of five words from the candidate set, {the cat, cat sat, sat on, on the, the mat}, within the reference set, it was found that three of these words are present in the reference set. Hence, the proportion is 0.6.

**Example2:**

candidate: the the the the the

reference: the cat is on the mat

bleu1 score = ‚Öñ = 0.4

We clipped the occurrence of ‚Äúthe‚Äù in the reference

### ROUGE

BLEU focuses on precision: how much the words (and/or n-grams) in the candidate model outputs appear in the human reference.

ROUGE focuses on recall: how much the words (and/or n-grams) in the human references appear in the candidate model outputs.


### Perplexity

Perplexity (PPL) is one of the most common metrics for evaluating language models. Intuitively, perplexity can be understood as a measure of uncertainty. The perplexity of a language model can be seen as the level of perplexity when predicting the following symbol.

Most language models estimate this probability as a product of each symbol's probability given its preceding symbols.


![alt_text](evaluations/images/image2.png "image_tooltip")


Perplexity is defined as the exponentiated average negative log-likelihood of a sequence. If we have a tokenized sequence ùëã=(ùë•0,ùë•1,‚Ä¶,ùë•ùë°), then the perplexity of ùëã is,


![alt_text](evaluations/images/image10.png "image_tooltip")


Where logùëùùúÉ(ùë•ùëñ‚à£ùë•&lt;ùëñ) is the log-likelihood of the ith token conditioned on the preceding tokens ùë•&lt;ùëñ according to our model. This is also equivalent to the exponentiation of the cross-entropy between the data and model predictions. So log(perplexity) = cross-entropy which is the training loss of the causal language model

### Benchmarks

Traditionally we have benchmarks for different tasks in NLP.

### LLM Benchmarks

Evaluate LLM should not focus on a single task in traditional NLP. Compare human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks from GPT-4 report.

Tools: Based on the [Language Model Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness), the [Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard) is the main benchmark for general-purpose LLMs (like ChatGPT). There are other popular benchmarks like [BigBench](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench), [MT-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685), etc.
